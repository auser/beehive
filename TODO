TODO:
* Investigate other databases as the distributed DB is not as "crucial" as speed of access (such as couchdb/riak)
* Clean up generally
* Add more finely grained ACL
* Update master mnesia node from seed node and distribute
* Take a nice long look at the permissions of the chroot environment on the node layer
* Add stats dumping to file
* Remove needless db queries in proxy process
* Throw error for creating duplicate users/apps/bees
* Add job-queue to handle tasks -> queue-driven
* Force not updating apps after they terminate
* Ensure apps update only on call, not otherwise
* Add more eunit tests
* Fix bee_timeout when app is starting
* Oauth? Http/basic
* Authentication for REST
* Vacation
* Bug - /apps deploy with min/max instances
* Separate application code into clean segments
* Add application revisions
* Make SHA (git) more flexible and work within the directory
* bh_rest stuff in beehive isn't really restful.  Odd http statuses and inconsistent response bodies.
